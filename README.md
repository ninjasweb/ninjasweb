# Hi, I'm Ali R. 👋

Software & AI Engineer focused on building **useful, human-centered products**.

I enjoy turning messy problems into simple, scalable solutions. I’m not just interested in writing code — I care deeply about **why** a product exists, **who** it helps, and **how** it feels to use. My goal is to create things people genuinely enjoy using and come back to.

I’ve worked across web, mobile, and AI-powered systems, often taking ideas from **zero to production**, optimizing them for performance, growth, and real-world impact.

## 🚀 What I care about

- Solving real problems with clean, practical solutions  
- Building products people *actually* want to use  
- Automating boring or complex processes with AI  
- Shipping fast, iterating faster  
- Creating systems that scale without becoming a nightmare
